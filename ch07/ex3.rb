Description :
Deaf grandma extended.
Extend program ex2 chapter 07
What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you.
Change your Deaf grandma program in ex2 chapter07 so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row.
Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.
